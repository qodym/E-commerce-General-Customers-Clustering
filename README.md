# E-commerce-General-Customers-Clustering

## **Overview**
**Introduction**

Hi, I'm Aldy Budhi Iskandar, a Data Scientist Enthusiast that just started my data learning journey through joining Dibimbing bootcamp Data Science Batch 13. This dataset is one branded e-commerce customers data with 2022-08-29 as the end time. The detailed data is including the basic customer information such as frequent transaction information, as well as the other transaction information.

This dataset consists of **24354 rows** and **7 columns**. In this project, we will do e-commerce customer value analysis through LRFMC indicators by performing K-Means clustering algorithm.

Contents:

`user_id` : Customers ID (unique value).

`total_transaction` : Total of customers transaction.

`total_money_spent` : Total of customers spent money (in IDR).

`tran_with_disc` : Total customers transaction using promo/discount.

`last_order_date` : Date on the customers last transaction (DateTime).

`created_at` : Customer join date (DateTime).

`data_pulled_date` : Date on data customers loaded (DateTime).

## **Background & The Steps**
**Background**

* Along with the development of information and technology accompanied by increasingly fierce business competition, the company is trying to shift from a product-centric approach to a customer-centric approach.
* A customer-centric approach will enable companies to create better relationships with customers, prioritize customer needs, and increase customer retention, which will lead to increased company profits.
* For this reason, companies need to classify customers accurately, formulate personalized service plans based on the classification results, and optimize enterprise marketing resource allocation plans.
* The aviation company's marketing team can establish a reasonable customer value evaluation model, segment customers, analyze and compare the value of customers from different groups, and formulate appropriate marketing strategies to provide personalized customer service according to customer needs.

**The steps in this project:**

* Data collection.
* Data understanding by performing the statistic descriptive of data.
* Data preprocessing that includes handling missing value, feature selection based on LRFMC, handling outlier and also data scaling.
* Clustering process by K-Means algorithm.
* Analyze the result - customer value analysis.

## **Conclusion**
From a variety of customers, can be classified into **4 groups** of the **five parameters** set (LRMFC) with the help of visualization using **Radar Chart** which aims to make clustering each user easier.
